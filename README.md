# Tujijenge User Documentation

**Tujijenge** is built around **location-based communities** of local vendors in Nairobi. These communities are the foundation of the platform - making it easier for suppliers and trainers to connect, engage, and deliver value to vendors within their area.

This document explains **how the community model works**, and how different users - vendors, suppliers, and trainers -interact within it.

---

## 🏘️ What Are Tujijenge Communities?

Tujijenge organizes vendors into **neighborhood-based micro-communities**, typically within a **1-kilometer radius**. Each community consists of vendors operating within the same locality, allowing them to:

- Share knowledge and questions
- Access suppliers nearby
- Receive targeted training
- Build local trust and accountability

These communities are automatically formed based on the **location** provided during registration.

---

## 👩🏾‍🌾 How Vendors Use Communities

Vendors are automatically placed into their nearest Tujijenge community. Inside their group, they can:

- Post **questions** or **challenges** they're facing
- See nearby **suppliers and trainers** available for support
- Access **offers** or **bulk discounts** shared with the group
- Organize or attend local **learning sessions** or **meet-ups**

Each vendor sees content, trainers, and suppliers that are **relevant to their area**, increasing convenience and trust.

## 🚛 How Suppliers Benefit from Vendor Communities

Suppliers are not just added to the platform—they are **mapped to vendor communities** in specific locations. This allows them to:

- **Reach a concentrated group** of active vendors in their delivery zone
- Share **bulk offers**, **discounts**, or **delivery schedules** directly to groups
- Get **real-time inquiries** from vendors in specific communities
- Reduce **delivery costs** by serving multiple nearby vendors at once

📌 **No cold selling** — suppliers engage with **warm leads** already organized by location.

## 🎓 How Trainers Use Vendor Communities

Trainers are also connected to location-based vendor groups. This allows them to:

- Promote **local training sessions** based on real vendor needs
- Get visibility among vendors **most likely to attend** based on proximity
- Offer **group sessions** or **follow-ups** for specific areas
- Build **ongoing mentorship** relationships within a community

💬 Trainers also participate in **community questions**, helping build credibility and relationships before sessions are even booked.

## 🤝 Why Communities Matter

Tujijenge communities are designed to:

- **Strengthen trust** between vendors and service providers
- Make logistics (like training or delivery) more **efficient**
- Help vendors feel **heard**, **connected**, and **supported**
- Enable trainers and suppliers to **focus on engagement**, not just outreach

## 📍 Real-World Example

> A supplier in Gikambura wants to deliver vegetables to vendors. Instead of posting publicly, they target the **Gikambura vendor group** — within walking or delivery distance. Vendors there are notified instantly, respond faster, and can even organize **group orders**.

> A trainer teaching mobile money management can create a **1-hour session** for the **Kawangware vendor group**, knowing most members are active during afternoons and share similar business challenges.

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

- **Suppliers**: Post offers to active communities. Focus on consistent presence over mass marketing.
- **Trainers**: Answer vendor questions — even before they book — to build trust.
- **Vendors**: Engage with your local group often — support from within your neighborhood is faster and stronger.
