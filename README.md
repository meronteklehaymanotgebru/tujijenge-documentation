# Tujijenge User Documentation

**Tujijenge** is built around **location-based communities** of local vendors in Nairobi. These communities are the foundation of the platform - making it easier for suppliers and trainers to connect, engage, and deliver value to vendors within their area.

This document explains **how the community model works**, and how different users - vendors, suppliers, and trainers -interact within it.

---

## 🏘️ What Are Tujijenge Communities?

Tujijenge organizes vendors into **neighborhood-based micro-communities**, typically within a **1-kilometer radius**. Each community consists of vendors operating within the same locality, allowing them to:

- Access suppliers nearby
- Receive targeted training
- Build local trust and accountability

These communities are automatically formed based on the **location** provided during registration.

---

## 👩🏾‍🌾 How Vendors Use Communities

Vendors are automatically placed into their nearest Tujijenge community. Inside their group, they can:

- Access **offers** from centeralized suppliers.
- Attend **learning sessions** and get ** verified**

Each vendor sees content, trainers, and suppliers that are **relevant to their area**, increasing convenience and trust.

---

## 🚛 How Suppliers Benefit from Vendor Communities

This allows them to:

- **Reach a concentrated group** of active vendors in their delivery zone
- Share **bulk offers** and  **delivery schedules** directly to groups
- Get **real-time inquiries** from vendors in specific communities
- Reduce **delivery costs** by serving multiple nearby vendors at once

📌 **No cold selling** — suppliers engage with **warm leads** already organized by location.

---

## 🎓 How Trainers Use Vendor Communities

Trainers are also connected to location-based vendor groups. This allows them to:

- Promote **training sessions** based on real vendor needs
- Get visibility among vendors **most likely to attend** based on proximity
- Offer **group sessions** or **follow-ups** for specific areas
- Build **ongoing mentorship** relationships within a community

---

## 🤝 Why Communities Matter

Tujijenge communities are designed to:

- **Strengthen trust** between vendors and service providers
- Make logistics (like training or delivery) more **efficient**
- Help vendors feel **heard**, **connected**, and **supported**
- Enable trainers and suppliers to **focus on engagement**, not just outreach
